# FAQ

Not seeing the answer you're looking at ? Please [open a PR](https://github.com/cfpio/callForPapers/pulls) with a new question !

## Is it a new UI or legacy one? I saw repo https://github.com/cfpio/front-proposals with a new UI.

We still run legacy UI, still need to complete the new UI development then switch the service. 

## Is it possible to set English as a default language?

Language is selected based on browser's preference. Please notice the whole UI might not have been translated to English (yet)

## Is it possible to export data after CFP will be closed? So we can import into our schedule 

We offer various export APIs to JSON, CSV, Sched.com

## There are some bugs in the admin panel, what is the best way to fix them?

We welcome pull request to fix the service https://github.com/cfpio/callForPapers/

## Is the UI customization (custom css) possible?

No. A simple way would be to have a configurable plain text attribute for custom CSS. We welcome pull-requests :P

## Is it possible to create custom fields for speaker profile and submission?

No. Let us know which information you'd like to request, maybe those would make sense for general usage.
